        <h1>Planning the Website</h1>
        <p>Before jumping into development, it's crucial to plan out the structure and content of the website. This post covers the initial steps and considerations in planning our website.</p>
        <p>We started by identifying the primary goals and audience for the website. Understanding who will use the site and what they will be looking for helps in making informed design and content decisions.</p>
        <p>Next, we outlined the main sections: Home, About, Portfolio, Blog, and Contact. Each section serves a specific purpose and provides essential information to visitors.</p>
        <p>We also sketched wireframes to visualize the layout and navigation. These wireframes acted as a blueprint, guiding us through the design and development phases.</p>
