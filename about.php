        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Stijn Clara, an aspiring web developer with a passion for creating engaging and user-friendly websites. My journey into web development began with a simple curiosity to understand how websites are built, which quickly grew into a full-fledged passion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I am new to the field, I am dedicated to learning and improving my skills. I've been immersing myself in online courses, tutorials, and coding challenges, which have helped me build a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and PHP.
        </p>
        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>
            I approach coding with a commitment to craftsmanship and a relentless pursuit of excellence. I believe that clean, efficient code and intuitive design are the keys to creating great user experiences. Every project, no matter how small, is an opportunity to push the boundaries of what I can achieve.
        </p>
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>
            Currently, I am seeking opportunities to gain practical experience and contribute to real-world projects. Whether through internships, freelance work, or collaborations, I am excited to apply my skills and learn from others in the industry. My ultimate goal is to become a well-rounded web developer capable of tackling a variety of challenges.
        </p>
        <h2>Beyond Coding</h2>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest trends in technology and web development. I am also interested in exploring other areas of tech, such as mobile app development and data science, to broaden my skill set and understanding of the field.
