            <h1>Developing with Bootstrap</h1>
            <p>Bootstrap provides a powerful framework for responsive design. Learn how we used Bootstrap to build the structure and layout of the website.</p>
            <p>Bootstrap's grid system allowed us to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. This ensures a consistent experience across devices.</p>
            <p>We utilized various Bootstrap components, such as the navbar, buttons, and cards, to maintain a consistent design language throughout the site.</p>
            <p>Custom CSS was added to tailor the Bootstrap framework to our specific needs, ensuring the site remained unique and aligned with our design vision.</p>
